## BracketHighlighter [(github)](https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter)
Bracket Highlighter matches a variety of brackets such as: `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `""`, `''`, `#!xml <tag></tag>`, and even custom brackets.

This was originally forked from pyparadigm's _SublimeBrackets_ and _SublimeTagmatcher_ (both are no longer available).  I forked this to fix some issues I had and to add some features I had wanted.  I also wanted to improve the efficiency of the matching.

Moving forward, I have thrown away all of the code and have completely rewritten the entire code base to allow for a more flexibility, faster, and more feature rich experience.

## Git [(github)](https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git)
These days, more often than not, you are going to work with a version control software, and the most popular VCS is Git. Are you tired of saving your text files and switching back to the terminal to run a few Git commands. Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if you could execute Git commands from the text editor itself? Install the Git plugin and get more done in less time!

## GitGutter [(github)](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter)
Although you can run Git commands from within Sublime Text, why check the differences in a file from the last commit by running a separate command when you can view it in real time?

With GitGutter, you can see which lines have been added, deleted or modified in the gutter.

## Terminal [(github)](https://github.com/wbond/sublime_terminal)
Just in case you want to open a terminal in the directory of your current file, this plugin can be of use. However, by default, it sets Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + t as the shortcut for opening the terminal, which is also the shortcut to open the last closed file. You should change either of the shortcuts to be able to use both functionalities!

## ColorPicker [(github)](http://weslly.github.io/ColorPicker/)
Usually, if you want to use a color picker you probably open Photoshop or GIMP and use the built-in color picker there. The ColorPicker plugin lets you use a color picker within Sublime Text! After installation, just press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + c.
